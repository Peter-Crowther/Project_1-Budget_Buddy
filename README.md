MoneyCashboard

You want to start tracking your spending in an attempt to be more frugal with money. You have decided to make a budgeting app to help you see where all of your money is being spent.

You must be able to create new Transactions ( which should include a merchant name, e.g. Tesco, and a value ) which have an associated Tag (e.g. 'food', 'clothes'). Your app would then be able to track a total, and display this in a view.

MVP:

Create new transactions
Display a list of all transactions
Display total amount spent
Display total amount spent by tag
Possible Extensions:

CRUD actions for the transactions
Show a warning when the total expenditure is over budget (set a hard coded budget first)
Add a date to the transactions and view total spending by month
Any other ideas you might come up with
User Notes:

brew install ruby
gem install sinatra sinatra-contrib.
gem install pg. (Postgres)
Create a database via 'createdb budget' in terminal.
Attach the budget.sql via 'psql -d budget -f db/budget.sql'
Run the server via 'ruby app.rb'
Access the website via 'localhost:4567/'


Experiences during the project:
Great to get stuck-in to my first project and consolidate my learning in Ruby and databases. Although this was a solo project, we worked in 
teams where we had all chosen the same project. K really enjoyed the morning scrums, hearing where we all were with the project and 
helping each other throughout the week, reviewing code, suggesting fixes, sharing research. Bit of an unknown when I started so very proud of
what was achieved within a week.
